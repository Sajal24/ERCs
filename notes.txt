what is the need to define an interface IERC for writing the ERC20 contract

An interface is a way to specify a contract's required functions without providing their implementations. By defining an interface for the ERC20 standard, you ensure that any contract that claims to implement the ERC20 standard must have the functions specified in the interface.

The purpose of using an interface for the ERC20 standard is to provide a clear and standard specification for developers to follow when creating their own ERC20 tokens. It helps ensure that all ERC20 tokens have the same basic functionality, making it easier for developers, exchanges, wallets, and other users to interact with them.

In the case of the ERC20 interface, it specifies the functions that are required to be implemented in a contract in order to be considered an ERC20 compliant token. These functions include things like transferring tokens, checking the balance of an account, and others. By implementing this interface, a contract demonstrates that it follows the ERC20 standard, making it easier for other contracts and users to interact with it in a predictable and well-understood manner.



difference between erc721 and erc20

ERC20 and ERC721 are both Ethereum-based token standards, but they have different purposes and features.

ERC20 is a widely adopted token standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Fungible tokens are interchangeable and have equal value. Each token is the same as the other, and they can be traded or exchanged with each other on a one-to-one basis. Examples of fungible tokens include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

On the other hand, ERC721 is a token standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Non-fungible tokens represent unique digital assets that are not interchangeable with other tokens. Each token has its own unique identifier, making it impossible to trade or exchange them on a one-to-one basis. Examples of non-fungible tokens include collectible items, gaming items, and artwork.

In summary, while ERC20 tokens are fungible and represent a standardized value, ERC721 tokens are non-fungible and represent unique, one-of-a-kind assets.
